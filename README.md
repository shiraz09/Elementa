# 🌿 Elementa

**Elementa** is a 2D nature-themed Match-3 puzzle game developed during the Unity x Bootcamp Gaming Program.  
In this game, players match elemental tiles — 💧 water, 🪨 earth, 🌿 grass, and ☀️ sun — to collect resources and craft powerful flower-based power-ups that help clear the board and progress through levels.
